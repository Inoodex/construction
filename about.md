## Architecture Patterns

### Approval Workflow System
- `Approvable` trait on models (PurchaseRequisition, PurchaseOrder, Invoice, Tender, Budget)
- `ApprovalWorkflow` → `ApprovalMatrix` (role + level + amount thresholds)
- `ApprovalService`: submit → approve/reject → level progression
- Full history in `approval_histories`

### Cost Overrun Detection
- `CostOverrunService`: checks budget utilization vs thresholds
- 80% = warning, 100% = danger, 120% = critical
- Creates/updates `CostOverrunAlert` with severity levels

### Earned Value Management (EVM)
- Budget model has `planned_value` (PV), `earned_value` (EV), `actual_cost` (AC)
- Computed accessors: `spi` (EV/PV), `cpi` (EV/AC), `etc` ((BAC-EV)/CPI), `eac` (AC+ETC), `variance` (BAC-AC)
- Dedicated forecasting view with summary cards and per-budget SPI/CPI/ETC/EAC table

### Super-Admin Gate
- `AuthServiceProvider`: `Gate::before` allows super-admins to bypass all checks

### Settings System
- Key-value `settings` table + global `get_setting()` helper

### BOQ Import
- `BoqItemsImport` (Maatwebsite Excel): chunked reading, validation, error reporting

### Material Takeoff Sheets
- `MaterialTakeoff` model: per-project material quantities linked to BOQ items
- Fields: description, unit, quantity, unit_price, total_price, source_drawing
- Full CRUD with project filter, linked to BOQ items for estimating takeoffs

### Project Progress
- `Project::progress` accessor averages all tasks' `progress_percent`
- Shown as progress bars on project index + show pages (color-coded)

### Task Dependencies
- `task_dependencies` pivot table links Task → Task (N:M)
- `Task::dependencies()` — tasks this task depends on
- `Task::dependentTasks()` — tasks that depend on this task
- Multi-select UI on create/edit forms; shown as link lists on show page

### Site Material Delivery Tracking
- `goods_received_notes.site_id` FK → sites (nullable, tracks delivery destination)
- `delivery_note` / `vehicle_number` fields on GRN for logistics tracking
- GRN create form: site selection filtered by PO's project, vehicle + delivery note fields
- GRN index: site column + site filter
- GRN show: delivery site, vehicle, delivery note displayed
- Site show: "Material Deliveries" table showing all GRNs delivered to that site

### Weather API Integration
- `WeatherService` (Open-Meteo): geocodes site address → lat/lng → current `temperature_2m` + `weather_code`
- "Fetch Weather" button on site log create/edit forms; calls `GET /dashboard/core/weather?location=...`
- Route: `admin.core.weather.fetch`, controller: `SiteLogController::fetchWeather`
- Free, no API key required; uses WMO weather code → human-readable description

### Resource Planning
- `task_resources` pivot table links `ProjectResource` → `Task` with allocated qty + dates
- `TaskResource` model: `task()`, `projectResource()` BelongsTo
- `Task::resources()`, `ProjectResource::taskAllocations()`, `ProjectResource::allocated_quantity` / `pending_quantity` accessors
- Resource allocation UI on Task create/edit (dynamic per-project resource picker)
- Project resource index shows allocation bar + linked tasks
- Resource Allocation Chart: Gantt timeline view at `projects/{id}/resource-gantt` + global picker at `resource-gantt`
- Sidebar/Horizontal: Core → Execution → Allocation Chart

### Error Handling
- Custom error pages for 403, 404, 419, 500, and 503 — each with branded SVG illustration, descriptive message, and action buttons (Go Back / Go Home / Try Again / Log In)
- `bootstrap/app.php` exception handler renders error views for `AuthenticationException`, `AccessDeniedHttpException`, `NotFoundHttpException`, `TokenMismatchException`, `ThrottleRequestsException`, `HttpException`, `ModelNotFoundException`, and `QueryException`
- `QueryException` handler provides user-friendly messages for integrity constraint violations (foreign key conflicts), duplicate entries, and missing tables
- Fallback catches all remaining `Throwable` and renders the 500 error page
- `APP_DEBUG=false` by default; set to `true` in `.env` for development stack traces

### HR — Attendance & Timesheets
- `Attendance` with `clock_in`/`clock_out` timestamps + status (present/absent/late/half-day/holiday)
- Bulk daily register via create form with select-all status buttons + time inputs
- Monthly summary per employee: counts by status + total worked hours
- `Timesheet` entries: employee logs hours against a project with start/end time and description
- Filterable timesheet list by employee, project, and date range
- Sidebar sub-menu organized into 5 groups: People, Payroll, Equipment & Assets, Safety & Compliance, Training

### HR — Wage Slips
- `WageSlip` auto-generated from attendance data per month
- Daily-rate calculation: `basic_salary / 30` × worked days (present + half-day*0.5 + late*0.75)
- Overtime from timesheets: hours > 8/day × 1.5× hourly rate
- 10% allowances, 5% deductions
- Print-optimized view with `window.print()`

### HR — Equipment & Assets
- `Equipment` registry: code, make/model, serial, acquisition type (owned/hired), purchase cost, depreciation tracking

- **Allocation to projects/sites**: FK columns + allocation/deallocation dates, filterable in list, selectable on create/edit, shown on show page
- Meter/hour tracking with maintenance interval and next-due alert
- `EquipmentMaintenance` records: preventive/corrective/inspection with cost, vendor, and next due date
- Inline maintenance history on equipment show page with quick meter update

### HR — Training & Certifications
- `TrainingRecord`: tracks employee training with provider, dates, certificate no, expiry, and cost
- Status workflow: planned → in-progress → completed → expired
- Filterable list by employee and status

### HR — PPE Issuance

- Severity: minor → moderate → serious → critical → fatal
- Status workflow: open → under-investigation → closed
- Rich detail view with root cause, corrective actions, investigation notes
